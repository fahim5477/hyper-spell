// The display draws whenever it likes; the simulation advances in fixed TICK_MS
// steps, as many as the elapsed real time paid for. A 144Hz monitor now draws
// 144 frames over the same 60 steps a 60Hz one runs, instead of racing ahead of
// the 60Hz server.
//
// The step callback hands stepSim nothing. The sim keeps its own clock now
// (simNow() = tick x TICK_MS) and advances the tick itself, so this loop's only
// job is deciding HOW MANY steps the elapsed real time paid for. The tick is
// deliberately not advanced here as well — that would run sim time at double
// rate.
// The cosmetic half of a tick rides the SAME fixed step as the sim half, and
// deliberately not the rAF frame. The sim emits its particles, shake, flashes
// and sounds during stepSim(); pumpEmitted turns them into a picture, and
// updateParticles ages that picture by exactly one tick — which is what
// `life` is counted in. Draining per frame instead would age particles at
// monitor rate and make a 144Hz screen burn through them 2.4x as fast.
