# HYPERSPELL

wizards · physics · violence — a couch/LAN party brawler. Last wizard standing wins the round, first to N rounds wins the match. 2–8 players, ~104 spells, ~104 maps.

## Play locally (couch)

Open `index.html` in a browser. Press **E**, **Enter**, or any gamepad button to join; **B** adds an AI bot (great for playing solo); **Space** to fight; **1–9** sets the win target.

## Play over the network (v2: the server runs the match)

The server is no longer a dumb relay — **the simulation runs on the server** (headless
Node, same game code) and every browser is a client. Nobody's tab is "the host": no
laptop lid closing can kill a match, and joining is just opening a URL.

macOS quick start: double-click `scripts/hyperspell-launcher.command` (or a copy on
your Desktop) — it starts the server and opens the game. `scripts/hyperspell-stop.command`
shuts it down. Manually:

```
cd server && npm install && node serve.js
```

- **One person starts the session:** open `http://<server-ip>:8787` (printed at startup) → type a name → **PLAY ONLINE** → **START A SESSION**. You get a six-character code and a **COPY THE INVITE LINK** button.
- **Everyone else joins with it:** same URL (or the invite link, which carries the code) → a name → **PLAY ONLINE** → type the code. Case and the dash don't matter — `abc def` opens `ABC-DEF`. It stays on screen in the lobby, so anyone can read it out to a latecomer.
- **The code is the door:** without it you can neither play nor watch. A session ends by itself once the room has been empty for a minute, and then anyone can start a new one.
- The lobby lives on the server: **SPACE** starts, **1–9** sets the win target, **B** adds a bot, **M** toggles wave survival, **R** resets. Anyone in the room can press them — starting the session buys no extra authority.
- Drop mid-match? Refresh and rejoin with the same name within 2 minutes — you get your seat and your round wins back.

## Play over Tailscale (remote players)

No config needed — the server listens on all interfaces and the client picks `ws://`/`wss://` automatically. On the machine running `node serve.js`:

1. Make sure it's on the tailnet, then either:
   - **Simplest:** share `http://<machine-name>.<tailnet>.ts.net:8787` (or its Tailscale IP from `tailscale ip -4`) with the team, or
   - **Cleaner URL + TLS:** run `tailscale serve --bg 8787` and share `https://<machine-name>.<tailnet>.ts.net`.
2. Everyone joining must be on the tailnet (invite them first). To open it to people outside the tailnet, use `tailscale funnel 8787` instead — that exposes it to the public internet.
3. Everyone opens the URL and clicks **PLAY ONLINE**; one person starts the session and shares the code (or the invite link). LAN and tailnet players mix — same server, same match, 8 wizards max, spectators unlimited (they need the code too).

Latency note: the sim is server-authoritative with no client prediction, so **every** player feels their wizard react one round-trip late — put the server close to the players (LAN or direct tailnet paths of 5–30ms feel fine). If `tailscale ping <server>` says "via DERP", that player's traffic is being relayed and will feel mushy — fixing their NAT/firewall usually restores a direct path. F8 shows live net stats.

## Host on a company server

`deploy/` has a full, reviewed-but-not-yet-run kit for a small always-on game server in the
company AWS account (tailnet-only or public-HTTPS + game key) — see `deploy/README.md`.

For hosting beyond a trusted LAN, the server supports a shared key: start it with
`GAME_KEY=somesecret node serve.js` and every page load and WebSocket needs the key —
share `http://<host>:8787/?key=somesecret` and the first click sets a cookie. Unset
(the default), nothing changes. The server also caps WS payloads (128KB), connection
count (`MAX_CONNS`, default 40), telemetry disk usage (50MB), and pings sockets every
30s so dead connections get reaped instead of hanging the room.
