# HyperSpell Online — Multiplayer Planning Doc

*Status: **Option A (server-authoritative) SHIPPED as v9, July 23 2026** — the sim runs headless in Node inside `server/serve.js` (see `server/sim-host.js` and `docs/PATCHNOTES.md`). The host-peer addendum below was the interim v6–v8 architecture and is now historical. Private lobbies with a shareable code shipped July 27 2026 (`server/session-code.js`; design in `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-27-session-codes-design.md`) — one session per server, and the code gates playing AND watching. Still open from the original ask: concurrent rooms (the sim is process-global, so that needs a worker thread per room), a lobby browser with auto-start, leaderboards, Hyperspell-account auth.*

*Originally: planning only. Written July 1, 2026. Updated July 2: cheating is explicitly a non-concern (internal easter egg product) — see the addendum at the bottom, which revises the recommendation toward feel and simplicity and shortens the estimates.*

## The ask

Take the couch-multiplayer wizard brawler and make it a genuinely online game that:

- lives alongside the Hyperspell product on Hyperspell infrastructure
- is playable by anyone with a Hyperspell account
- has **joinable lobbies** that auto-start when enough players are in
- has **leaderboards**

## TL;DR difficulty verdict

**Moderate — 3-6 weeks to a solid MVP, not a rewrite.** *(July 2 update: with cheating declared a non-concern, the addendum's host-peer + client-authoritative plan cuts the first shippable online version to ~1-1.5 weeks.)* Two facts make this much easier than it would normally be:

1. **The simulation already runs headless.** Our smoke-test harness runs the complete game (Matter.js physics, all 106 spells, all 104 maps) in Node with no browser, no canvas, no real clock. That harness is ~80% of a game server's core loop. This is the hard part of most "make it online" projects, and we accidentally already built it.
2. **Hyperspell's stack fits.** Clerk JWTs for auth, K8s for stateful game-server pods, Postgres for leaderboards, Vercel/Next.js for the client shell. No new vendor needed.

The genuinely hard part is not infrastructure — it's **netcode feel**: a chaotic physics brawler is the worst-case genre for latency. That's where the risk and the polish time live.

---

## What we have today

- Client-only, zero-build: plain JS modules + Matter.js, one shared world simulation
- Input is already abstracted (`Controller.poll()` → `{move, jump, cast, ...}`) — a "NetworkController" is a natural drop-in
- Sim and rendering are in separate files but share globals; they need a formal split (see Phase 1)
- Nondeterminism everywhere (`Math.random()` in spells/maps) — fine for server-authoritative, rules out lockstep without work

## Architecture options

### Option A — Server-authoritative (recommended)

Server runs the real simulation in Node (headless Matter.js, 60 Hz). Clients send inputs (~30 Hz), server broadcasts world snapshots (~20-30 Hz), clients interpolate between snapshots and render.

- ✅ Cheat-proof by construction (server owns truth — matters if there's a leaderboard)
- ✅ No determinism requirement — keep `Math.random()`, keep all 106 spells as-is
- ✅ Our headless harness proves the server sim works today
- ⚠️ Snapshot bandwidth: a busy round is ~100-200 bodies; naive JSON is ~50-100 KB/s/client. Needs delta compression + quantization (well-trodden problem)
- ⚠️ Input latency: your own wizard reacts one RTT late. At <60 ms ping this is barely felt in a party game; client-side prediction for *your own movement only* can come later if it feels mushy

### Option B — Deterministic lockstep / rollback (GGPO-style)

All clients simulate; only inputs cross the wire.

- ✅ Minimal bandwidth, best feel at low ping
- ❌ Requires perfect determinism: seeded RNG everywhere, fixed timestep, no `performance.now()` in sim — a real refactor of 106 spells
- ❌ Rollback + full physics resim of 200 bodies × 7 frames is CPU-heavy
- ❌ Cheating is trivial (every client knows everything) — bad with leaderboards
- **Verdict: wrong fit.**

### Option C — Host-peer (one client is the server, WebRTC)

- ✅ Nearly free to run
- ❌ Host advantage + host migration pain + trivial cheating + NAT/TURN complexity
- **Verdict: fine for a friends-only toy, wrong for accounts + leaderboards.**

```

**Game server.** Node process, one instance hosts many rooms (a 4-player room is one Matter world — a vCPU should carry 20-40 rooms; needs a load test). Deployed as a K8s Deployment alongside the core (ArgoCD like everything else). Rooms are ephemeral; a Redis or in-Postgres room registry maps `roomId → pod` for routing (or start simpler: one pod, vertical scale, shard later).

**Protocol.** WebSockets (WSS). Client→server: `{tick, move, jump, cast}` only — never positions (that's the anti-cheat). Server→client: delta-compressed snapshots (body positions/velocities quantized to int16, spell/effect events as one-shot messages so lightning bolts, banners, and sounds don't need to be in every frame).

**Client.** Same rendering code we have; the sim files are replaced by "apply snapshots + interpolate 100 ms behind." The game becomes a Next.js page or static site at e.g. `play.hyperspell.com`, Vercel-deployed like the other web apps. Login = existing Clerk session; the WS handshake carries the JWT; server validates it (same JWKS as core).

**Lobbies (the flow Conor described).**
- Lobby browser: list of open rooms with player count, map-theme vote, win target
- Click to join → you're a wizard in a pre-game arena (our current LOBBY state, but online — people can run around and grab lobby tomes while waiting, which is already how the local lobby works)
- Room auto-starts when full (4) or when ≥2 players are ready and a 30 s countdown expires
- Private lobbies: 4-letter room code to share with friends *(shipped July 27 2026, as six characters — see the status line at the top)*
- Later: quick-match button that just puts you in the emptiest open room

**Leaderboards.** Postgres tables keyed on Hyperspell account id:
- `matches(id, room, started_at, winner_account, win_target)` and `match_players(match, account, round_wins, kills, deaths)`
- Rankings: start with wins + a simple Elo; weekly season views are just a `WHERE started_at > season_start`
- Fun stats basically free since the server sees everything: kills by spell ("most Rubber Duck kills"), HYPERSPELL procs, bananas slipped on — these make the leaderboard page *feel* like the game

## Work plan & estimates

| Phase | What | Est. |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Sim/render split.** Extract deterministic-ish sim core (physics, spells, maps, rules) from render/audio/input into a module that runs in browser *and* Node. The smoke harness is the proof rig. | 1-1.5 wk |
| 2 | **Game server + protocol.** Rooms, WS, snapshot encode/delta, client interpolation, event channel for spells/banners/SFX. First playable online match (LAN feel). | 1.5-2 wk |
| 3 | **Lobbies + auth.** Clerk JWT validation on WS, lobby browser, auto-start countdown, private codes. | 1 wk |
| 4 | **Leaderboards.** Match recording, rankings API, a leaderboard page. | 3-4 d |
| 5 | **Feel + ops.** Latency tuning (maybe own-wizard prediction), reconnect handling, load test rooms/pod, deploy via ArgoCD, region choice (start us-west-2 only). | 1-2 wk |

**MVP (phases 1-4): ~4 weeks. Demo-grade online prototype (phases 1-2 only, hardcoded room): ~2 weeks.** At the pace this project has moved, realistically faster — but netcode feel iteration is play-test-bound, not typing-bound.

## Cheap fallback if we want leaderboards without netcode

Keep the game couch-multiplayer, add Clerk login + report match results to a leaderboard API (~2-3 days). Office ladder, zero netcode risk. Could ship this *first* while the real thing is built.

## Risks & open questions

1. **Latency feel** — biggest risk. Physics brawler + 100 ms ping = floaty. Mitigations: interpolation delay tuning, own-input prediction, regional servers. Must playtest early with real cross-country ping (Phase 2 exit criterion).
2. **Bandwidth** — busy rounds (Meteor Storm × 4 players) spike body counts; needs delta compression and per-effect events, not naive state dumps. Solved problem, but real work.
3. **Server cost** — rooms are stateful CPU; idle-scale to zero matters if usage is bursty. One small node covers an office; public playability needs autoscaling thought.
4. **Abuse/moderation** — public lobbies with strangers: name filtering, report/kick, rate limits on room creation. Small but nonzero scope.
5. **Account linkage** — confirm Clerk app/tenant to use, and whether "anyone with a Hyperspell account" means customers too (support/brand questions) or employees first (recommend: employees + invited friends first season).
6. **Mobile/touch** — out of scope for MVP; keyboard/gamepad only.

## Suggested sequencing

1. Ship the **office ladder** fallback now (days, zero risk, builds hype)
2. Phase 1-2 spike to a playable two-browser prototype over the real internet — this answers the only question that matters (*does it feel good?*) before we commit to the rest
3. If feel is good → phases 3-5 and a company-wide season one

## Addendum (July 2): cheating is a non-concern — optimize for feel

David's direction: this is an internal easter-egg product. Nobody will cheat on the
leaderboard, and any performance/feel gain that "increases cheating risk" is fine.
That removes the constraint that forced the strictest architecture. Revised takes:

### What changes

**1. Client-authoritative own movement (the big one).**
Instead of sending inputs and waiting a round trip to see your own wizard move,
each client *simulates its own wizard locally* and broadcasts position/velocity.
The server (or host) accepts it as truth. Your controls feel exactly like the
couch game — zero perceived input latency, no prediction/reconciliation code at
all. Knockback from remote explosions arrives as impulse events you apply to
yourself. Occasional divergence (a crate shoves you on the server but not locally)
is invisible chaos in a game that is already chaos. This was off the table with a
trusted leaderboard; now it's the default.

**2. Host-peer becomes a legitimate Phase-2 shortcut (Option C, rehabilitated).**
One browser hosts the whole sim (we know it runs headless — it can certainly run
in a tab); friends connect over WebRTC data channels. The Hyperspell server only
does signaling (tiny) and records results for the leaderboard. In an office —
same building, same network — latency is single-digit milliseconds and it plays
identically to couch mode. Zero game-server infrastructure to build, deploy, or
scale. Host closes their tab mid-match? The match just ends — acceptable for an
easter egg. This cuts the online prototype from ~2 weeks to roughly **one**.

**3. Simpler wire format.** Skip delta compression and quantization for v1 —
plain JSON snapshots at 20 Hz are fine on office wifi for 4 players. Optimize
only if someone plays from home and complains.

**4. Drop from scope entirely:** input validation, movement sanity checks,
abuse/moderation for public lobbies (it's colleagues), report/kick flows.

### Revised recommendation

- **v1 (≈1-1.5 weeks):** host-peer WebRTC. Sim/render split (Phase 1, still
  needed) + a host tab that owns the world + client-authoritative wizards +
  lobby codes via a tiny signaling endpoint + results POSTed to the leaderboard.
  Trust everything. Ship it to the office.
- **v2 (only if wanted):** move the host sim onto a K8s pod (the code is the
  same headless sim) so matches don't depend on someone's laptop tab, add the
  lobby browser + auto-start countdown, keep client-authoritative movement.
  This is the "lives on Hyperspell servers" version — roughly +1.5-2 weeks.

Leaderboard integrity note, for honesty: with client-authoritative everything,
the leaderboard is a gentleman's agreement. Given the audience (the company),
that's exactly what it should be. If it ever goes customer-facing, revisit the
original Option A — the doc above still describes it.

---

## Addendum (July 9): "host it somewhere so remote teammates can log in and play"

David's ask: we have players who aren't in the office; get the game hosted so
anyone can reach it and play. Cheating reaffirmed as a non-concern — internal
only, trust everything. This addendum is the concrete, minimal v1 plan; it
supersedes nothing above but is the current marching order.

### Where we actually are today (grounding facts)

- `server/serve.js` **already relays remote players** — it's how Tailscale play
  works now. It listens on all interfaces; the client auto-picks `ws://`/`wss://`
  from the page protocol (`js/net.js:118`). Remote reach is a *deploy + access*
  problem, not a netcode rewrite.
- Still host-authoritative with **no client prediction**: one browser tab clicks
  HOST ONLINE and runs the whole sim; the server just passes messages. Own-wizard
  input lags a round trip — fine on LAN/Tailscale-direct, mushy cross-country.
- **No login exists.** Whoever reaches the URL and presses E grabs a slot.

### v1 plan (leanest thing that gets remote teammates playing)

Do these in order; step 2 first because it de-risks the only thing that could
disappoint (does remote *feel* good?).

1. **Client-authoritative own-movement.** Each client simulates its own wizard
   locally and broadcasts position/velocity; everyone trusts it. Kills perceived
   input latency, no prediction/reconciliation code. This is the highest-value,
   smallest-risk change and the reason remote play feels like couch play. Prove
   it in a two-browser cross-internet test before investing in hosting.
2. **Deploy `serve.js` to an always-on host with TLS.** Stable public home
   (`wss://play.hyperspell.com`) so there's no launcher and no laptop tab holding
   the door open. Dockerfile + Fly.io / tiny EC2 / Hyperspell K8s. ~1 day.
3. **"Log in" = minimal.** Internal + trust-everything means real auth is
   optional. A name field (the lobby already is one) or shared room code
   satisfies "log in and play." Google SSO on the company domain is the
   low-effort upgrade if we want names to follow people / feed a leaderboard —
   but v1 is not gated on it.

Explicitly **out of v1 scope:** Clerk, lobby browser, leaderboards, sim-on-server.
Those are the "if people love it" follow-on (the doc's Option A / addendum-v2).

### Known limitation we're accepting for v1

The sim still runs in one player's **host tab** — if the host closes the tab, the
match ends. Acceptable for an internal easter egg. Removing that dependency means
moving the host sim onto the server pod (same headless sim code), ~+1.5–2 weeks —
the v2 upgrade, only if tab-dependence becomes annoying in practice.
