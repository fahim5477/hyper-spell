// debug-globals.js — a compatibility surface for the dev harness pages.
//
// controller-test.html, shot.html, smoke-test.html, wave-play.html and
// wave-test.html drive the game from an inline <script> that names functions
// directly — free, back when every file was a classic script sharing one global
// scope. The bundle has no such scope, so the entry publishes the surface those
// pages use. Nothing in src/ reads it: it is a dev affordance, not an API, and
// the pages are its only consumers.
